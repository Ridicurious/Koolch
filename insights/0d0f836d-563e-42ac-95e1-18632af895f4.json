Game theory offers structured models to simulate and understand competitive and cooperative strategic interactions among rational agents. By integrating these models into generative systems, which are designed to autonomously create new data and behavior patterns, significant advancements can be achieved across various fields such as autonomous systems, robotics, and AI-driven content generation.</p>\n\n<h3>Literature Review</h3>\n<p>This section reviews selected papers from the bibliography provided, focusing on their contributions to understanding the application of game theory in generative agent systems.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>\"Evolutionary Game Theory Squared: Evolving Agents in Endogenously Evolving Zero-Sum Games\"</strong>\n    <ul>\n      <li>This paper explores dynamic interactions where both agents and games evolve strategically over time in zero-sum settings.
